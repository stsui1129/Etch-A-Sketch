This is my Etch-A-Sketch project for the Odin Project. I had to figure out how to generate grids using javascript and draw over the grid when moused over them.
Problem encountered: Unless I set the gridsize to >64, the grid does not generate enough cells when I change the gridsize. Problem with coding?
I will come back to this problem another time.
